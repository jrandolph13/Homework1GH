>Stash Investments also known as Stash Banking was founded February 19, 2015 by the trio Brandon Kreig, David Ronick, and Ed Robinson. Krieg and Robinson worked closely together on Wall Street, both culminating over 15 years of experience as financial advisors, handling generally well-versed and high wealth clientele. During this time on Wall Street it became apparent that on more than an occasional basis the pair found themselves answering basic questions across their firm, such as “Where should my money go and where do I start?” This stemming not only from a lack of access to resources, but also from the challenges associated with high entrance barriers and an overall lack of general knowledge. Stash’s third founder David Ronick, a TechStars mentor based in New York, brought a technical background helped to shape the vision and product into the working interface that we see today using technologies such as Lean Canvas. Ronick has since departed from Stash to focus on the development of disruptive technology within the healthcare industry. 
The founder’s initial plans and objects with the application were stemmed from the idea that they wanted to create a financial subscription service aimed at helping everyone create, obtain and maintain their own unique financial goals. Their innovation would aim to directly challenge entry barriers that at one time often brought about angst and intimidation amongst novice investors. Funding for Stash has seen consistent growth during its time having raised over $427.4 Million over 10 financial rounds, the latest of which being a series G held in February of 2021. Currently the brand is exploring the option of an IPO after surpassing a $1.3 billion valuation as a result of the round. Leading investors into the app include Union Square Ventures, Couture, and Goodwater Capital.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

>Stash offers a wide variety of services under its platform. In addition to financial literacy tools, the initial stages of the app also included a $5 minimum requirement to begin investing in around 30 ETF’s that were geared towards unique customer preference.  This has now spurred a unique wave into the market of what is now considered “socially conscious investing”. This practice has since expanded to include roughly 1800 individual stocks and ETF’s that can each be purchased for as little as a penny. Along with these investments they have expanded to include direct banking and retirement planning onto the platform.
	The company’s average user is identified as 29 years of age with an income of $45,000 annually. As of 2017, subscription levels passed 1 million with 5 million expected in a short period of time. Growth that competitors are finding hard to match as trust is proving an extreme factor for those involved. Stash is often referred to as the only option amongst its competitors that allow users to effectively save on a more informed basis. In a world that is ever becoming socially conscious, the ability for Stash to monetize movements and causes continues to be a central focus of the company.  
The financial literacy and robo advisors integrated within the apps design provides a competitive advantage that competing apps do not offer. They offer an algorithm that directly advises products based on a customers specific investment risk. ETF’s are also a large part of their differential as well. They offer funds focused on a wide variety of products that span across multiple industry verticals, allowing their user to invest from an informed standpoint. Stash uses 71 unique business applications mainly Java, Python, HTMLS, React and Swift. David Ronick would oversee the implementation of these technologies and their impact on the app as a whole.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?


>Stash is taking great leaps within the Capital Investment and Micro-Advising domains. For the first time investors have a direct line that helps to promote wealth on their own budget. Their ability to offer a direct literacy tool  and impact fee structure allows for easy transition into maintaining the financial goals of their customers on a consistent basis, even when the markets themselves are closed. 
	Other major companies within this space include Soul Capital, First Lexington, Robinhood, WeBull and StockSpot. Many of these options also offer fractional trading in the same regard, however the difference stands within the literacy tools and the advance metrics used in providing real time analysis on real time KPI’s.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

>Stash has had a positive contribution within its market vertical to date. In addition to leading the charge in fee reduction across the industry, they have also successfully made retail investing more accessible. Through the AARRR method, also known as the Pirate Method defined by Dave McClure Stash is able to track its performance and growth on a more direct basis. Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referrals, and Revenues are all tools used to keep track of how growth within the company has excelled over its life cycle, especially so as they prepare for an upcoming IPO. 
Public opinion is the biggest performance indicator in such a young domain. The trials of Robinhood and their choice to halt trading on a popular block of stocks earlier in the year triggered lawsuits and cancellation of subscriptions. Companies such as Stash and Acorn would do best to learn from the trials of their competition in order to identify and best address the ever-growing needs of their customers.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

>In my opinion, Stash is doing an excellent job in exceeding and maintaining their goals to provide an experience aimed to arm the casual investor with knowledge that allows the induvial to grow alongside the app. The influx in securities offered show that Stash is dedicated and listening to the consumer. The addition of cryptocurrencies and the subsequent knowledge associated would go a long way in expanding the popularity of the app. As of now, Robinhood is the only one in this space to offer these crypto services. However, without providing the necessary knowledge to accompany these services they significantly raise the risk associated with trading such securities. Utilizing the technology would mean Stash may have to acquire or partner with more financial literacy applications specifically within the cryptocurrency space. 
	In conclusion, Stash has an immense amount of potential and continues to grow at a solid pace. If anything, their ability to raise above the trials of Robinhood do a great job at annotating this point on its own.

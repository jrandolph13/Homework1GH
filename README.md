  Stash Investments or Stash Banking was founded Feb 19, 2015 by the trio of Brandon Kreig, David Ronick, and Ed Robinson. Brandon Krieg currently serves has served as CEO of the brand and has done so since its inception. Krieg and Robinson were co-workers, having worked over 15 years on wall street on a daily basis with well-versed financial clientele. At one point in time it would become apparent that answering basic questions such as “where should my money go?” was a universal question stemming not from a lack of knowledge, but rather by the entrance barriers commonly associated with investing. Secondly, they realized that most of the people within their own companies and teams didn’t feel as if they had the capital required to begin trading. Needs that could easily be addressed given the right tools. It was in moments like this where Ronick and fellow co-founder Ed Robinson saw an opportunity. Stash’s third founder David Ronick TechStars mentor based in New York, brought a technical background helped to shape the vision and product into the working interface that we see today using technologies such as Lean Canvas to develop and shape the plan. Ronick has since departed from Stash to focus on the development of disruptive technology within the healthcare industry. 
  The founder’s initial plans and objects with the application were stemmed in the idea that they wanted to create a financial subscription service aimed at helping everyone create, obtain and maintain their own unique financial goals. Initially the platform only included around 30 ETF funds providing users a low risk option towards investing along with automated advising and financial literacy tools. Their innovation would aim to directly challenge entry barriers that at one time often brought about angst and intimidation amongst green investors. Funding for Stash has seen consistent growth during its time having raised over 427.4 Million in funding over 10 financial rounds the latest of which being a series G held in February of 2021. Currently the brand is exploring the option of an IPO after surpassing a $1.3 billion valuation as a result of that investment round. Leading investors into the app include Union Square Ventures, Couture, and Goodwater Capital.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Stash offers a wide variety of services under its platform. In the initial stages of the app $5 was required to begin investing in around 30 ETF’s that were geared towards unique customer preference, what many are now calling “social investing”. This practice has since expanded to include roughly 1800 individual stocks and ETF’s that can each be purchased for as little as a penny. Along with these investments they have expanded to include direct banking and retirement planning onto the platform while continuing to acquiring companies promoting financial literacy as well. 
	The company’s average user is identified as 29 years of age with an income of $45,000 annually. As of 2017 subscription levels passed 1 million with 5 million expected in a short period of time. Growth that competitors are finding hard to match as trust is proving an extreme factor for those involved. Stash is often referred to as the option amongst its competitors that allow for users to effectively save on a more informed basis than any other companies currently operating within the capital investment and micro-advising domains. In a world that is ever becoming socially conscious, the ability for Stash to monetize movements and causes is impressive. 
The financial literacy and robo advisors integrated within the apps design provides a competitive advantage that competing apps do not offer. They offer an algorithm that not only advises products based on a customer’s investment risk unlike counterparts with similar products. ETF’s are also a large part of their deferential as well. They offer funds focused on a wide variety of products that span across multiple industry verticals. Allowing their user to invest from an informed standpoint. Stash uses 71 unique business applications mainly Java, Python, HTMLS, React and Swift. David Ronick was important to the implementation of these technologies and their impact on the app as a whole.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?


Stash is taking great leaps within the Capital Investment and Micro-Advising domains. For the first time investors have a direct line that helps to promote wealth on their own budget. Their ability to impact fee structure and offer a direct literacy tool allows for easy transition into maintaining the financial goals of their customers on a consistent basis, even when the markets themselves are closed. 
	Other major companies within this space include Soul Capital, First Lexington, Robinhood, WeBull and StockSpot. Many of these options also offer fractional trading in the same regard, however the difference stands within the literacy tools and the advance metrics used in providing real time analysis on real time KPI’s.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

 Stash has benefited from a positive impact of the company so far. In addition to leading the charge in fee reduction in the industry they have successfully made retail investing more accessible. Consistent growth in subscriptions totaling over to now almost well over a million, shows that the desire and need for effective guidance and literacy is always appreciated and welcomed within the space.  Through the AARRR method defined by Dave McClure also known as the pirate method, stash is able to track its performance and growth on a more direct basis. Activation, Retention, Referrals, and Revenues are all tools used to keep track of how the growth of the company has excelled over its life cycle, especially so as we they prepare for an upcoming IPO. 
Public opinion is the biggest performance indicator in such a young domain. The trials of Robinhood and their choice to halt trading on a popular block of stocks earlier in the year triggered lawsuits and cancelation of subscriptions. Companies such as Stash and Acorn would do best to learn from the trials of their competition in order to identify and best address the ever-growing needs of their customers.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

In my opinion Stash is doing an excellent job in hitting their goals and stride in order to maintain the goal of providing an experience aimed to arm the casual investor with knowledge that allow one to grow alongside the app. The influx in securities offered show that Stash is dedicated and listening to the consumer. The addition of cryptocurrencies and the subsequent knowledge associated would go a long way. As of now Robinhood is the only one in this space to offer these services, however without providing the necessary knowledge the risk associated with allowing access is tricky. Utilizing the technology would mean Stash may have to acquire or partner with more financial literacy applications and companies specifically within that space. 
	In conclusion stash has an immense amount of potential and continues to grow at a solid pace. If anything, the trials of Robinhood do a great job at annotating this on its own.
